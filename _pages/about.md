I am a 4th year PhD Student in Mechanical Engineering at Boston University researching topics in interfacial fluid dynamics. More specifically, I use fluid dynamic modeling, experimentation, and numerics to investigate the forces acting on particles and bubbles near fluid interfaces (fluid-air and fluid-solid). Currently, I am interested in applying these ideas to topics including biofouling mitigation, collective animal behavior, and ocean foam structure and stability.

Outside my academic interests, I am also interested in drinking good coffee, reading interesting books, and running.
